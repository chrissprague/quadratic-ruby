==============

program used to learn the basics of Ruby, evaluate quadratic formula

Inspiration:
a) first and foremost, to learn more about the Ruby programming language.
b) my chemistry course has been discussing chemical equilibria in depth,
specifically Kc, Kp, Keq, Kw, Ka, and Kb, and problems that fall under
these categories often involve the use of the quadratic formula, so
why not kill two birds with one stone?
